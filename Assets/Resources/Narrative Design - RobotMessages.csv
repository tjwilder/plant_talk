Once correct hint chemical hint of hint 1.b plays	BOT-NE	Now that's one vivacious corn plant!				2.c.1
	BOT-NE	Scan zea mays again, notice anything?	Gameplay:player scans plant again, then next dialogue plays			2.c.2
Player finishes scanning	BOT-NE	When plants don't need nitrogen, they stop producing this signal				2.c.3
	BOT-NE	That's called a negative signal. It says when something's missing.				2.c.4
	BOT-NE	What are you waiting for? Write that down! This is real science! 	Gameplay: UI journal element flashes, players open notebook which contains nitrogen signal rule			2.c.5

	BOT-NE	Solanum lycopersicum. They're a little bashful, always blushing.				3.a.1

3.b	Bot-ne points out that there are two signals					
Trigger	Character	Dialogue	Designer Notes	Aritst Notes	Dialogue feedback	ID
Player tries to add just nitrogen a few times unsuccessfully.	BOT-NE	This tomato does need nitrogen, but the signal's not changing.				3.b.1
	BOT-NE	This means the plant can't absorb nitrogen. Yet.				3.b.2
	BOT-NE	Hmm, maybe the plant needs something else first?	Gameplay: player scans plant again.		Is Iron a positive or negative signal? In the current alpha version it's positive so the second plant is _less_ chatty because it's missing the iron symbol. So it would be more like "I feel like something's missing here! See, there's that other signal from your lab notebook!"	3.b.3

3.c	Bot-ne explains about positive signals					
Trigger	Character	Dialogue	Designer Notes	Aritst Notes	Dialogue feedback	ID
Player successfully adds iron.	BOT-NE	Wow, a new signal appeared!				3.c.1
	BOT-NE	Don't worry, that just means this is a positive signal.				3.c.2
	BOT-NE	The tomato is saying "I have enough iron".				3.c.3
	BOT-NE	You know the drill. Notebook! For science!	Gameplay: notebook UI flashes, new entry added.			3.c.4

Trigger	Character	Dialogue	Designer Notes	Aritst Notes	Dialogue feedback	ID
Player successfully adds nitrogen	BOT-NE	I'm impressed, seedling! This is way above intern-level stuff.				3.d.1
	BOT-NE	The tomato was communicating with themselves.				3.d.2
	BOT-NE	They needed iron before they could absorb nitrogen.				3.d.3
	BOT-NE	The tomato waited for the "I have iron" signal.				3.d.4
	BOT-NE	Only then did they absorb the nitrogen you gave it.				3.d.5
	BOT-NE	And then stopped saying "I don't have nitrogen".				3.d.6
	BOT-NE	So, plant signals can be interdependent. 				3.d.7
	BOT-NE	Which is science talk for "plants talk to themselves"! Notebook!	Gameplay: notebook UI flashes, new entry added.			3.d.8

	BOT-NE	Remember, scientists take notes about everything they observe.				1.b.1
	BOT-NE	Like how I'm just the pluckiest little bot you've ever seen!				1.b.2
	BOT-NE	Jokes aside, lets get to the real science. Come see the first plant.	Gameplay:first plant appears on screen			1.b.3

	BOT-NE	This my friend zea mays. She thinks it's corny when I use her full name.				2.a.1
	BOT-NE	She's trying to talk to you, but I take it you don't speak plant, right?				2.a.2
	BOT-NE	Luckily, I've got the next best thing. Wrap your twigs around this.	Gameplay: UI element flashes, players can control scanner. Hint sequence 1.a plays			2.a.3

Once the last hint of hints 1.a plays	BOT-NE	Zea is telling us she wants something.				2.b.1
	BOT-NE	To find out what, we've got to the scientific method.				2.b.2
	BOT-NE	Try adding these chemicals. See if the signals change.	Gameplay: player can access chemical tray. Hint sequence 1.b plays			2.b.3

Once correct hint chemical hint of hint 1.b plays	BOT-NE	Now that's one vivacious corn plant!				2.c.1
	BOT-NE	Scan zea mays again, notice anything?	Gameplay:player scans plant again, then next dialogue plays			2.c.2
Player finishes scanning	BOT-NE	When plants don't need nitrogen, they stop producing this signal				2.c.3
	BOT-NE	That's called a negative signal. It says when something's missing.				2.c.4
	BOT-NE	What are you waiting for? Write that down! This is real science! 	Gameplay: UI journal element flashes, players open notebook which contains nitrogen signal rule			2.c.5

Once players close notebook	BOT-NE	You've completed your first experiment! Congrats, seedling!				2.d.1
	BOT-NE	Now you know that red signals is plant talk for "nitrogen, please!"				2.d.2
	BOT-NE	Let's go see what some of the other plants are saying. Bet it's real sappy.	Gameplay: transition to next plant			2.d.3

	BOT-NE	Solanum lycopersicum. They're a little bashful, always blushing.				3.a.1

3.b	Bot-ne points out that there are two signals					
Trigger	Character	Dialogue	Designer Notes	Aritst Notes	Dialogue feedback	ID
Player tries to add just nitrogen a few times unsuccessfully.	BOT-NE	This tomato does need nitrogen, but the signal's not changing.				3.b.1
	BOT-NE	This means the plant can't absorb nitrogen. Yet.				3.b.2
	BOT-NE	This plant's chattier than the last one. Did you see any other signals?	Gameplay: player scans plant again.		Is Iron a positive or negative signal? In the current alpha version it's positive so the second plant is _less_ chatty because it's missing the iron symbol. So it would be more like "I feel like something's missing here! See, there's that other signal from your lab notebook!"	3.b.3

3.c	Bot-ne explains about positive signals

Player successfully adds iron.	BOT-NE	You added the right chemical, but the signal's not gone.				3.c.1
	BOT-NE	Don't worry, that's because this is a positive signal.				3.c.2
	BOT-NE	The tomato is saying "I have enough iron".				3.c.3
	BOT-NE	You know the drill. Notebook! For science!	Gameplay: notebook UI flashes, new entry added.			3.c.4

3.d	Bot-ne reinforces interdependent signals					
Trigger	Character	Dialogue	Designer Notes	Aritst Notes	Dialogue feedback	ID
Player successfully adds nitrogen	BOT-NE	I'm impressed, seedling! This is way above intern-level stuff.				3.d.1
	BOT-NE	The tomato was communicating with themselves				3.d.2
	BOT-NE	They needed iron before they could absorb nitrogen.				3.d.3
	BOT-NE	The tomato waited for the "I have iron" signal.				3.d.4
	BOT-NE	Only then did they absorb the nitrogen you gave it.				3.d.5
	BOT-NE	And then stopped saying "I don't have nitrogen".				3.d.6
	BOT-NE	So, plant signals can be interdependent. 				3.d.7
	BOT-NE	Which is science talk for "plants talk to themselves"! Notebook!	Gameplay: notebook UI flashes, new entry added.			3.d.8

# Plant Talk (rename plz)

Currently using Unity 6000.1.3f1

## Setup

1. `git clone` the project
2. In Unity Hub, Add Existing Project to add the folder you just cloned/downloaded
3. In Unity Hub, you can click the little Warning Icon if you don't have the right Unity version and it can install it directly.
4. When you first launch, the project will say that there are errors and ask if you want to open it in Safe Mode. Do that!
5. Go to `Window > Package Management > Package Manager`
6. In `Unity Registry` section, search for `Input System` and install it. Then search for and install `Universal Render Pipeline`. These will take a bit to install, especially the Universal Render Pipeline
7. Once those are both installed it should automatically recompile the code and exit safe mode
8. You may need to open up the Scene `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene` if it doesn't open by default (that is, if you don't see a Plant or anything else in the scene, then you need to open the "SampleScene")
8. It should boot into regular mode and you should be able to just click Play to run it

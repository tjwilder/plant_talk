# Plant Talk (rename plz)

Currently using Unity 6000.1.3f1

When you first launch it will most likely have Compiler errors. You need to open the Package Manager and install "Universal Render Pipeline" and "Input System" (you might have to search a few of the sub menus and I might not have the names 100% correct). Once those are both installed it should automatically exit safe mode and it should work.
